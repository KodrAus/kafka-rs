# kafka-rs

## Dead Project Alert :(

For a proper client see: [kafka-rust](https://github.com/spicavigo/kafka-rust)

This was a very early attempt at building an [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) client in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

The project was a way to learn the Rust language and test some ideas for what's become my [elasticsearch client](https://github.com/KodrAus/elasticsearch-rs)
